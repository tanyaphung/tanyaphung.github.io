# Welcome!
I am a bioinformatics scientist. I am interested in writing and using computer programs to analyze large-scale genomic datasets with the ultimate goal of understanding genetics variation and human health and diseases.

Currently, I am working with Dr. Melissa Wilson at Arizona State University. I am investigating sex-differences to contribute to better understand human health. 

I earned my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics program at the University of California, Los Angeles in December 2018. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the Massachusetts of Technology in June 2014.
