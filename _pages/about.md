# Welcome!
I am a bioinformatics scientist working in the field of population genetics. I am passionate about writing codes to analyze large-scale genomic datasets with the ultimate goal of understanding pattern of genetic variation across the genome.

Currently, I am working with Dr. Melissa Wilson at Arizona State University. I will continue working on population genetics, specifically focusing on sex chromosomes. In addition, I will be applying my bioinformatics skills in analyzing cancer datasets. 

I earned my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics program at the University of California, Los Angeles in December 2018. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the Massachusetts of Technology in June 2014.
