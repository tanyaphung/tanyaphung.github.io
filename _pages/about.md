# Welcome!
I am a bioinformatics scientist working in the field of population genetics. I am passionate about writing codes to analyze large-scale genomic datasets with the ultimate goal of understanding pattern of genetic variation across the genome.

I earned my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics program at the University of California, Los Angeles in December 2018. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the Massachusetts of Technology in June 2014. Starting in January 2019, I will be working with Dr. Melissa Wilson Sayres at the Arizona State University as a postdoc.

# News:
**11/26/18** I successfully defended my PhD thesis from the Bioinformatics program at UCLA.
