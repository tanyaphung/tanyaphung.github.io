# Welcome!
I am a bioinformatics scientist skilled in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data (WGS, WES, and RNA-seq). I am passionate about utilizing bioinformatics as a tool to udnerstand genetic variant, human health, and diseases. 

Currently I am a bioinformatics scientist at Xbiome where I am investigating the relationship between the tumor neoantigens and the gut microbiota to better treat cancer patients using immunotherapy. 

Previously I was a bioinformatics scientist at Ambry Genetics where I maintained and developed in-house pipelines for somatic variant identification from NGS data. 

Prior to joining Ambry Genetics, I was a post-doc working with Dr. Melissa Wilson at Arizona State University where I investigated sex-differences to contribute to better understand human health. Briefly, I studied the process called X-chromosome-inactivation in the human placenta to understand factors that could contribute to pregnancuy complications. In addition, I developed bioinformatics pipelines to identify tumor neoantigens to study the neoantigens landscape of a patient with Lynch syndrome. 

I earned my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics program at the University of California, Los Angeles in December 2018. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the Massachusetts of Technology in June 2014.

# News:
**10/03/19** Our work on understanding patterns of X-inactivation in the human placenta is now on bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/785105v1

**05/22/19** My PhD work on understanding sex-biased demography in dogs and wolves is now published at Proceeding of Royal Society B: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1976.

**12/31/18** I started working with Dr. Melissa Wilson at Arizona State University as a post-doc.

**11/26/18** I successfully defended my PhD thesis from the Bioinformatics program at UCLA.
