Below describes my coding projects and links to my Github repository

## Project 1: Develop a tool called `vcfhelper` in Python to aid with processing variant-calling-format (VCF) files. 
* `vcfhelper` extracts any annotations of interest of the VCF file which can then be used to plot for visualization

## Project 4: rshiny app projects
- Over the years, I have developed applications in Rshiny to share results from my research. 
- [Github repo](https://github.com/tanyaphung/rshiny_tutorial) where I share some notes on Rshiny development. 
- I have published the following Rshiny apps: 
1. NIPT analyses:
