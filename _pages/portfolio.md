Below describes my coding projects and links to my Github repository

## Bioinformatics workflow/pipeline
1. Pipeline for identification of variants from whole exome/genome (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/NGS_pipeline))
2. Pipeline for processing bulkRNAseq (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/ald_ipsc_rnaseq))
3. Pipeline for processing single-cell RNAseq (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/rnaseq_analysis_scripts))
4. Pipeline for identification of tumor variants and neoepitope (Github link [here](https://github.com/SexChrLab/Cancer_Genomics))
5. Pipeline for running analyses on UKB-RAP (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/ukb_rap_workflows))
6. Pipeline for running FUMA Cell type on the command line (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/FUMA_Celltype_cmd))


## Rshiny app projects
1. Notes on Rshiny development (Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/rshiny_tutorial))
2. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) (link [here](https://tanyaphung.shinyapps.io/nipt_analyses/))
3. Visualization of patterns of X chromosome inactivation (link [here](https://tanyaphung.shinyapps.io/X-inactivation/))
4. Visualization of availability of scRNAseq data (link [here](https://tanyaphung.shinyapps.io/scrna_category_rshiny/))

## Webtool development
- As part of my work at the VU, I am maintaining and updating a webtool called FUMA. Here are some of the tasks I have contributed to: 
    * Implemented a functionality to delete jobs by administrator (Github link [here](https://github.com/vufuma/FUMA-webapp/pull/39/files))
    * Updated the GUI for one of the pages (Github link [here](https://github.com/vufuma/FUMA-webapp/pull/5/files))

## Other
1. Develop a tool called `vcfhelper` in Python to aid with processing variant-calling-format (VCF) files. 
* `vcfhelper` extracts any annotations of interest of the VCF file which can then be used to plot for visualization

2. Parse GTEx dataset
* Github link [here](https://github.com/tanyaphung/ParseGtex)
