Below describes my coding projects and links to my Github repository

## Project 1: Develop a tool called `vcfhelper` in Python to aid with processing variant-calling-format (VCF) files. 
* `vcfhelper` extracts any annotations of interest of the VCF file which can then be used to plot for visualization
