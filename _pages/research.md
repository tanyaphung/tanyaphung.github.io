# Current research
My current research focuses on using large-scale genomic data (whole genome, whole exome, and RNA-seq) to understand health and disease
## X-inactivation
## Neoepitope prediction
## Variant calling on the sex chromosome

# PhD Research
My research during my PhD centers around leveraging the availability of large-scale genomic data to develop methods and models for the analysis of genetic variation across species. 

## Natural selection
Does natural selection reduces variation at sites that are putatively neutral? Population geneticists have postulated that neutral sites could also be affected by natural selection if they are linked to those directly under selection, via genetic hitchhiking or background selection. Even though genetic diversity (DNA differences within species) at neutral sites has been shown to be reduced by linked selection, whether linked selection has also affected divergence (DNA differences between species) was still debated. I utilized genome-wide divergence data between species with different split times (i.e. human-chimp and human-mouse) to show that natural selection has also reduced divergence at linked neutral sites. I also developed a likelihood method to model different evolutionary forces, particularly linked selection, mutagenic recombination, and biased gene conversion in shaping patterns of divergence across the genome.

## Sex-biased demography
Comparing and constrating the genetic diversity between the X chromosome and the autosomes is a tool to study whether any evolutionary process has been sex-biased and has been fruitful in providing insights into human evolutionary history. Recently, studying the genetics and the evolutionary history of dogs has captured the fascination of both scientists and the public alike. Despite documented sex-biased mating practices in both wild and domestic population of canines, current studies have not investigated whether any evolutionary process has been sex-biased. I used whole-genome sequence data from multiple populations of dogs and wolves to test whether the demography of canines has been sex-biased.

## Genetic architecture
Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is key to unravel the genetic basis of complex traits. I leverage summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to develop a method to infer the mutational target size for each complex trait. I also study the extent to which selection is coupled with the variant's effect on the trait.
